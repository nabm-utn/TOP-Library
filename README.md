# TOP-Library
This is "The Odin Project" First project in the JavaScript Course inside the "FullStack JS Developer Path"

As of today (august 8th 2021) the project is "completed", i.e the tasks requirements are fullfilled.
However, i'm not satisfies with the way it looks, and i think i could add several features. Those are described in the "Future Improvements" section. I'll probably return to the project after learning more things about design and algorithms.

# Future Improvements
* Add a button for deleting all books from library.
* Use a grid layout for the bookshelf.
* Make the site mobile friendly.
* Add an option for sorting books by name, author and/or number of pages.
* Add an option for adding X ammount of pre-generated books (mainly literature classics).
* Make the new book form appear on demand.
